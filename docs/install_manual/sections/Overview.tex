\section{Introduction}

The LpzRobots-Simulation is a robot simulation programmed at the university of Leipzig. Its main features
include the \emph{ode\_robots}, which is a 3D robot simulator, that is physically correct, and the so called
\emph{selforg}, that is a framework for controller implementation. \\
The important parts of the software architecture are shown in Figure: \ref{architecture}: \\

\emph{ThisSim} will, during a simulation, integrate all elements of this very simulation, which means controlling
the environment, the robot, as well as setting initial parameters and plotting or logging data. \\
\emph{Agent} will integrate all elements of an agent by using the shown classes, one can for example add sensory preprocessing
using a child class of \emph{AbstractWiring}. \newline

\newpage
For working with the LpzRobots-Simulation, you will need a couple of things:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item A (preferably up-to-date) UNIX-based Operating System (state of the art: Ubuntu 11.10 or Debian 6.0)
 \item The Eclipse-Software combined with the following packages:
      \begin{itemize}
       \item C/C++ SDK
       \item The EGit-Tool-Kit
      \end{itemize}
 \item Access to the Assembla-Repository (contact your supervisor for access)
 \item The setUpGoRobots.zip file (contact your supervisor for the file)
\end{enumerate}
