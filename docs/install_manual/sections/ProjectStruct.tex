\section{Project Structure}

We use, as already mentioned, two GIT repositories, LpzRobots and GoRobots.

Later, the controllers for each robot will be implemented within \emph{GoRobots}, accessing the robots, which are located in \emph{LpzRobots}. The folder \emph{DEMO} will later contain demos of the different robots.
Another visualisation of the two repositories and where which file belongs is given in Figure \ref{struc2}.

You will later work with your own copy of the two repositories.
