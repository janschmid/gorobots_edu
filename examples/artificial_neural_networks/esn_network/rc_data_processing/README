To use the RC network for input-output mapping

1) Prepare your data into two files: input file and target file and put them into the resources folder

For example, in the resources folder, 

there are:
the input file--> "InputData_4000_noise.txt.txt" under the folder: resources/cpg_footsensor_data
the target or desired output file--> "TargetData_4000.txt" under the folder: resources/cpg_footsensor_data

The input file contains --> one input

///////
If input file contains more than one inputs, e.g., 3 inputs, you have to arrange the file as:

Column1 = Input1 ! Column2 = Input2 ! Column3 = Input3
///////


The target file contains --> one output

Column1 = output of the network

Note that the first part of the data will be used to train and the remaining part will be used to test the trained model!


2) Open 'main.cpp' in the src folder
  
-Set the path to the input and target files

      //Foot sensor data
    	string inputPath                    = "resources/cpg_footsensor_data/InputData_4000_noise.txt"; //percentage_1 = 90.0
    	string targetPath                   = "resources/cpg_footsensor_data/TargetData_4000.txt";//



-Set number of input, output, and hidden neurons
 
        unsigned int numberOfInputs         = 1;
        unsigned int numberOfOutputs        = 1;
        unsigned int numberOfHiddenUnits    = 70;
       
 
 
-Set learning parameters 

        double inputSparsity                = 20.0;
        double internalSparsity             = 50.0;
        double learningRate                 = 0.99;
        
        
      
-Sat how many data points you want to use for training  

For example,    
      
double percentage_1                 = 80.0; //  80% of total data for "training" (save)

This means that 80 % of total data points will be used to train the RC network and the remaining data points 20% will be used to test the network


3) All weights after learning will be saved in the save_files folder

4) The output data of the network, Target data, and error data will be saved in the results folder
