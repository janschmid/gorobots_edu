Software for tracking Trajectories from video

You need to use a video with a constant background and a main feature(can be an object, a person walking etc..)
You also need to have a small colored feature you want to track in the video, for example
a circle of constant color. 

Right now you can detect up to three trajectories, meaning that you have to have a videoclip with three colored circles
on the main feature. You need to be sure that the colors that you are tracking don't appear anywhere else in the frame.
Of course you can also have a videoclip with two colors, one or even any(if you just want to show the video you uploaded).

Trajectories will be shown but you can also save them in a file like (x y) coordinates.



-----------------TO DO----------------------
Please open the main.cpp file and go in the SETTING sections, here the comments will help you 
to set few things in order to have the data you need.
